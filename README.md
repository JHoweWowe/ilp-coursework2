# Informatics Large Practical (ILP) 2020-21 Coursework 2

**Idea:** Program an autonomous drone which (fictiously) collects readings from air quality sensors around the University of Edinburgh area. The challenge is to collect those readings within 150 moves or less, and without flying into No-Fly-Zones and the drone flight path must be within a certain area. The drone's starting location will always be in the given area. Further details can be found in the ILP Coursework document.

 Using my own enhanced greedy algorithm, described in the ILP Report, has allowed me to implement this task effectively.

**Final Grade:** 81% (A2)

**Programming Language**: Java

**IDE**: Eclipse

## Personal Notes
Tackling this coursework assignment was quite interesting, as I had to implement proper software engineering practices, previously learned in Year 1 and 2, into this project. In addition, I got to apply concepts previously learned in university into a world problem.

## Brief Instructions
1. Starting up the WebServer
    - Running the web server can be done using Terminal
    - Go to the directory containing the WebServer
    - `java -jar WebServerLite.jar`
    - To verify the web server is running can be done by visiting the address `http://localhost:80` in your web browser
    - If localhost cannot be run on port 80, try on port 9898 using the following command: `java -jar WebServerLite.jar /path/to/web/server/content/ 9898`
    - Obviously please change the path to appropriate path in your directory
2. Running the Java program
    - There are two options: command line and IDE
    - Command Line: `java -jar target/aqmaps-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 15 06 2021 55.9444 -3.1878 5678 9898`
        - The last seven arguments take in the day, month, year, starting latitude, starting longtitude, seed, and port number of web server respectively
    - IDE:
        - Preferred IDE is Eclipse
        - Execute the last seven arguments from command line and run it in App.java main class
        - Example: `15 06 2021 55.9444 -3.1878 5678 9898`
        - The last seven arguments take in the day, month, year, starting latitude, starting longtitude, seed, and port number of web server respectively

    - Once executed, it would generate a flightpath text file and geojson file respectively corresponding to a date into your current directory.
    - You can render the content from the geojson file on geojson.io

The first image above shows the algorithm generated for the date 2020-01-01. This clearly showed the drone in the middle of its flying route was stuck but managed to get out of the loop and finish the route.

The next image above shows the algorithm generated for the date 2020-03-03, simulating a perfect drone flight path.
